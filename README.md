# Linux-Admin-Helper
 Simple menu-driven script that allows the user to perform various tasks related to user management, network configuration, and system information. The script is intended to be run with root privileges, as indicated by the initial comment and the sudo commands used for some operations.

 Here's a breakdown of what each option in the script does:

* Adduser: Allows the addition of a new user to the system. The script prompts the user to enter a username and password, and then it adds the user using the useradd command.

* Ssh_server: Installs the OpenSSH server on the system using apt-get.

* Route: Displays the network routing table using route and sudo route -n.

* Processes: Shows information about running processes using ps.

* IP: Displays the network interface configurations using ifconfig.

* Change_Ip: Allows the user to change the IP address of the system by providing a new IP address for the network interface eth0.

* Change_Netmask: Allows the user to change the netmask of the system by providing a new netmask for the network interface eth0.

* Change_Gateway: Allows the user to change the default gateway of the system by providing a new gateway address.

The script uses a select loop to present the user with a menu of options, and based on the user's choice, it executes the corresponding code block for that option.

Please note that the script includes some security checks, such as preventing non-root users from adding new users to the system, as indicated by the check for root privileges using id -u.

One improvement that could be made to the script is to add a trap to handle unexpected exits gracefully and cleanup temporary files if any. Additionally, it's always a good practice to validate user inputs to ensure they are in the correct format before using them in commands.
